excerpt: 'We propose that feminine gay men are targets of essentialist beliefs that cast them as less natural and more entitative than masculine gay men, and that this pattern of low-naturalness/high-entitativity beliefs fuels increased sexual prejudice toward, and discomfort with, feminine gay men.'

'We examined associations of perceived ambivalent sexism with women’s outcomes in university Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses as a function of their STEM identity. Women 
(N = 592) who varied in STEM identification reported on their personal experiences with benevolent 
and hostile sexism and indicated their STEM major intentions, STEM self-efficacy, and STEM grade point 
average (GPA). Women perceived more benevolent sexism (i.e., protective paternalism and complementary 
gender differentiation) than hostile sexism in STEM courses, and their STEM identity moderated the 
associations between sexism and STEM outcomes. Among weakly-identified (but not strongly-identified)
women, protective paternalism predicted lower STEM major intentions, STEM self-efficacy, and STEM GPA; 
hostile sexism predicted lower STEM GPA. Male STEM students (N = 163) reported more protective paternalism 
attitudes than hostile sexism attitudes, suggesting that women’s perceptions were not without warrant. We 
discuss implications of these results for understanding women’s underrepresentation in STEM and advise STEM 
educators to avoid well-intended, but paternalistic, messages that convey negative stereotypes about women’s 
STEM competence.'
